/*Good Approach (GFG pe chalta)=>
Time Complexity and Space Complexity: It cannot be predicted for this particular algorithm because there 
can be multiple sequences of transformation from startWord to targetWord depending upon the example, so 
we cannot define a fixed range of time or space in which this program would run for all the test cases.

Note: This approach/code will give TLE when solved on the Leetcode platform due to the strict time 
constraints being put up there. So, you need to optimize it to a greater extent in order to pass all the 
test cases for LeetCode.For the optimized approach to this question please check out the next video.*/
